A wise person always leaves an even number of weak groups.
Memorising Joseki is all you need to become a strong Go player.
One eye beats two eyes.
One eye is all you need to live.
Only a moron connects against a peep.
Play where your opponent wants you to play.
Proverbs are never wrong.
When in a life-and-death situation, tenuki!
When in doubt, play the empty triangle.
